  ----------------- README --------------------------------

  This repository consists of two main parts: (1) A library
  with classes and functions to construct a heterogenous
  agent continuous time model (HACTLib) and (2) code that
  implements the library. HACTLib was designed so that its
  components can be used independently, so the user may
  implement the library with his/her own code. See the
  HACTLib readme for details.
