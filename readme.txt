This repository contains code for two models: a one-asset
model with disutility of adjusting consumption, and one-asset/
two-asset model with a cost of deposits/withdrawals into or
out of the illiquid asset. Each package may contain code that
is shared between both models and code that is unique to one 
model or the other. The 'two_asset' and 'con_effort'
subdirectories in each package contain code that is specific 
to one of the models. For the most part, code in the main
package directories is shared by both models.
